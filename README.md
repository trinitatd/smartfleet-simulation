# 🚌 SmartFleet Multi-Bus Simulator
( Currently Inactive )

Welcome to **SmartFleet**, an intelligent, dynamic bus allocation system powered by Firebase! This simulator is designed to emulate real-world public transportation logic—where buses automatically adjust based on occupancy and demand across multiple routes.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔥 Real-time dashboard with Firebase Firestore
- 🚍 Simulates 10 buses across 10 unique routes
- 👥 Passengers dynamically enter at each stop
- ⛔ When a bus is full, a new one is auto-dispatched
- 🖥️ Live bus data visualization
- 🎨 Beautiful UI with custom alerts


## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML, CSS, JS**
- **Firebase Firestore (Realtime Database)**
- GitHub Pages (for deployment)

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Click **Simulate Stop for All Buses** to begin.
2. Each bus moves to the next stop every 3 seconds.
3. Random passengers board at each stop.
4. Once a bus reaches max capacity (40), a new one is dispatched.
5. All activity is updated live on the dashboard.
